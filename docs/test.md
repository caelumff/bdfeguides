### Notes
While I list them by effects, take note of the followings:
* The horizontal order of the equipment pictures is the same as the vertical order of the tables.
* When the particular effect is unlocked at skill level 15, i.e. consume 5 legend coins, there will be a legend coin in the equipment picture.
* When the particular effect is a slot effect, the slot number in the equipment picture will appear black.

The tiering is based on early game value while endgame value is rated separately for each gear. Endgame Tier lists the gears you will want eventually as you hit the endgame but not beginner-friendly.

# S Tier

## Aspir

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/0MC0hVZO.png)
* Endgame Value: S
* Since Black Mages main in dealing damage with flashy and explosive special attacks. So using Aspir to maintain healthy BP supply is mandatory to deal consistent damage.

## Magic Barrier

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/aRbl5QSX.png)
* Endgame Value: B
* Without a Knight, Black Mages tend to be targeted by enemies. Black Mages' low PDef doesn't help.
* Warning: All magic barrier rods have long reload.

**Split** and **Concentrate** allow Black Mages to have unparalleled AoE DPS. Most rods carry these two buffs in one except wind.

Endgame Value: A

While not carrying buffs, these **2-hit nukes** with 50% MDef ignore are the standard attacking rods with high base damage, reasonable reload and short cast time.

These **multi-hit** rods are also great attacking rods with their own advantage.

When you start to hit damage cap even with multi-hitting rods, you will want to have **Limit Break**. They increase your damage potential tremendously.
