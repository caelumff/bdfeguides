**Weakness 3** is highly coveted by parties to deal a lot of damage in a short time. **Mono water** set is usually easier to use due to versatility. There are other water bows that help in a mono water set but these are the more important ones.

Despite Forceless being counterpart of Weakness, **Stat-reduction** actually works better than Forceless in reducing incoming damage, while letting party to deal more damage as a bonus. For some reason all of them are AoE except Twilight Bow.

**Debuff Extension** is very helpful to ensure that the debuffs stay on instead of keeping track of expiration time of each buff, especially if there's a knight who uses taunt.

**Slow** decreases the frequency of attacks while **slowcast** gives more room to dodge red tiles or brace for upcoming attacks. Both are good to deal with aggresive bosses or bosses with a lot of lethal red tiles. Slow 2 and 3 do not differ that much, usually used in conjunction to stack both effects.

These come with **Weakness 1** plus additional effect. However 3-star bows with Weakness 1 as awakening effects are sufficient mostly.
