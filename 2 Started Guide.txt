# Knowing Yourself And Your Enemies
## Element
Four elements in this game. The weakness relationship is as follows: Fire > Wind > Earth > Water > Fire.

Element|Japanese
---|---
Fire | 火
Water | 水
Earth | 土
Wind | 風

All weapons and armours have elements. All monsters also have elements. It is important to gear against the monster you are facing, e.g. gearing fire to fight wind monster.

## Family
Some equipment effect has advantage against certain family of monsters. All monsters have families. All enemy players (in PVP) are considered humanoid.

## Buffs
There are three main types of buffs. Blue buffs are usually stats increment, stacking up to a certain percentage depending on the stats. Green buffs of the same level overwrite when recasted, but different levels stack. For example, Default 2 stacks with Default 3, but if Default 3 is casted again it will only replace the existing Default 3. Yellow buffs are boss-only buffs that cannot be dispelled. *See also: [Status Effects](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/?guide_effects), [Status Effects (Visual)](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/?effects_shiny).*

In addition to buffs above, some bosses do Power-Ups (パワーアップ), which result in permanent increase of all parameters and faster attacks. There are no icons and they cannot be dispelled.

## Debuffs
There are two types of debuffs. Red debuffs are usually stats decrement and always overwritten when reapplied. *See also: [Status Effects](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/?guide_effects), [Status Effects (Visual)](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/?effects_shiny).*

Purple Debuffs that stack up to 5 times:

Debuff|Japanese
---|---
Poison | 毒
Burn | 火傷
Seal | 封印

Purple Debuffs that stack for different levels:

Debuff|Japanese
---|---
Weakness | ウィークネス
Forceless | フォースレス
Slowcast | スロウキャスト
Slow | スロウ
Bleed | 出血
Waste | 衰弱

Purple Debuffs that have no levels, and thus do not stack:

Debuff|Japanese
---|---
Taunt | 挑発
Bind | バインド
Blind | 暗闇
Stop | ストップ

There are special penalties that cannot be cleansed unless by dying and getting revived. There are no icons and usually last for 10 minutes. 

* Max BP reduction
	* Reduce a percentage of current max BP for the duration. 
	* Penalties from Chain Sword, Elemental Taunts, Phalanx 3 for Knights as well as Quartz Book and Spiritual Book for White Mages.
* Reload/BP penalty
	* Increase special reload and BP cost of all specials
	* Penalties from AoE Taunt for Knights.

Special Debuffs are debuffs that have a special deep purple icon to the left to your name. They cannot be removed normally. Sometimes they can be removed by dying and getting revived but bosses tend to reapply quickly.

Debuff|Japanese
---|---
Trial | 試練
Doom | 死亡宣告
Blind (Special) | ブラインド
Gravity | 重力
Curse | 呪詛

Iconless debuffs are also special debuffs but do not have any icons to identify. Their potency varies from boss to boss without a clear indicator. Otherwise they behave the same way. While most are literal in what they do, Power-Down (パワーダウン) results in permanent decrease of all stats as well as increase in auto and special reload time.

Debuff|Japanese
---|---
Max HP Down | 最大HP-
Max BP Down | 最大BP-
Auto Reload Increase | 通常リロード時間+
Special Reload Increase| 必殺リロード時間+
Power-Down | パワーダウン

## Tile Effects
Tile effects are effects of the terrain that activate depend on where you stand. Sometimes boss applies tile effects for the whole field. They usually have different visual effects on the ground.

Tile Effect|Visual Appearance|Effect
---|---|---
Burning Tiles | Red/Blue/Violet flames | Reduce HP periodically proportional to current Max HP. HP reduction increases if under the debuff Burn.
Poison Tiles | Green bubbles | Inflict poison periodically up to 5 stacks. Poison immunity works.
Blind Tiles | Black clouds | Inflict blind periodically. Blind immunity works.
Slow Tiles | Spider webs | Inflict slow periodically. Slow immunity works.
Doom Tiles | Black glow | Inflict doom. Disappears once inflicted.
Reverse Tiles | Pink (taller) flame | Refer to Abyss floor 85 for details.

# How to Gear (Basic)
The following is just a basic rule of thumb on how to gear. There will be more things to take not as you advance depending on your job. A more comprehensive guideline is in Bossing Guide. First things first, revise the elemental advantage: Fire -> Wind -> Earth -> Water -> Fire

## Armours
Do not get rid of lower rarity gears until you have complete set of the element of higher rarity. Always try to wear armours strong against the enemy. Each piece of armour adds elemental resist to element it is strong against, and cuts elemental resist to element it is weak against, i.e. avoid wearing wind armours against fire enemies.

## Weapons
Like armours, do not get rid of lower rarity gears until you have complete set of the element of higher rarity. You gain 25% additional elemental damage each piece of weapon of that element you are equipped with. It is always encouraged to weapons of the same element instead of having full set of high rarity gears but different elements.

## Medals
Medals are not obtained by Gacha but only events or monster drops. For starters, it is advisable to gather a set of slimes until you can survive better.
