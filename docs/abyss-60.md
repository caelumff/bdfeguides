# Witch of the Depths
![Boss](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/BYr6admW.jpg)
* <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="25"> Earth/Aerial/???
* HP: 602,750
* Debuffs: Blind, Seal

# Overview
* Normal attacks knock back, probably better to stick in back row unless breaking bar when DPS is thief
* The challenge is not the boss herself but the minions she summons (triggered by Roar of Ground).
* By roaring, she summons 2 minions and buffs herself with invincibility.
* The trick is to defeat the minions within the bar duration to break bar to prevent party wipe.
* She will remove her invincibility after minions are defeated. Hit her with at least 1 damage to break bar.
	* And then, she will buff herself with brave/default after bar breaks.
* Left minion seals; right minion blinds.

* Blind resistance helps.

## White Mage
* Be mindful of the debuffs on DPS; cleanse blind ASAP especially.
* Seal resistance helps.
