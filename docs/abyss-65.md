# Hell Tyrant
![Boss](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/14mjTM22.jpg)
* <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="25"> Fire/Demon/Magical
* HP: 810,238
* Debuffs: Burn, Blind, Slow, Seal

# Overview
* Rather than bar breaking or HP-based thresholds, this boss has time-based thresholds.
* I.e. the nukes and patterns are all according to the time after fight started.
* It gets really dangerous after 7 minutes 30 seconds. So it is usually a DPS race to clear before that.
* There are no lethal single tile nukes, so if there are 2 healers, it is more usual to stay in 1 row and tank everything without dodging.

# Pattern/Thresholds

# Tips
## Knight
* Bait when single red marker is on you.
* Make sure to return to the rest quickly.

## White Mage
* BP management to buff after buff release.
* Prioritize default and/or Mdef buffs.
* Seal resistance helps, else try to dodge red tiles.

## Black Mage / Thief
* Just DPS.
* Be aware of buff dispels.

## Ranger
* Prepare to dispel when needed. 
* Weakness debuffs to clear before 7:30.
