# Pattern/Threshold

## Phase 1
* One of the four penalties. However at this stage it is not as noticeable.
* Seal happens around after some duration into the phase.
	* Since it is the only skill that targets whole party, White Mage can time cleanse mid-cast.
	* If done fast enough, you will not see Seal.
* Penalty shifts after seal attack. (could be the same penalty)
* When ~1,220,000 HP, enters phase 2 by leaving the battlefield and replaced with two smaller pixies.

## Phase 2
* Arthur - HP 502,400
* Philip - HP 555,200
* Either combination of auto/special reload increase or Max HP/BP decrease
* Penalty shifts after some time. (could be the same penalty)
* Split into two, one being "Correct" and another being "Wrong".
* About which being which, it is RNG.
* When the wrong pixie is defeated, it will die and be revived, buffing Power-up on both pixies.
* When the correct pixie is defeated, it will endure at 1 HP and cast something to proceed into next phase.
* Since the attacks start to become pretty lethal after power-up, try to have the other pixie at low HP before killing one.

## Phase 3
* HP 922,368
* Small pixies leave the battlefield, replaced by Pixie Milligan
* Start with Brave 3, Default 3.
* Two random penalties out of the four.
* After certain time interval, Party Seal followed Brave 3 + Default 3
	* Since it is the only skill that targets whole party, White Mage can time cleanse mid-cast.
	* If done fast enough, you will not see Seal.
* Penalties shift after seal attack. (could be the same penalties)
* When ~610,000 HP, enters phase 4 by leaving the battle field, replaced with four smaller pixies.

## Phase 4
* Ragen - HP 581,600 - Auto reload increase
* Allen - HP 555,200 - Special auto increase
* Tommy - HP 502,400 - Max HP down
* Danny - HP 476,000 - Max BP decrease
* Split into four, one of them being "Correct".
* All four of them inflict one of the battle panelties each.
* Defeating the one that inflicts that penalty will remove it for the rest of the phase.
* The correct pixie will start healing other pixies when own HP is low. (~250,000 HP)
* When the correct pixie is defeated, it will endure at 1 HP and cast something to proceed into next phase.

## Phase 5
* HP 230,592
* Small pixies leave the battlefield, replaced by Pixie Milligan
* Start with Brave 3, Default 3
* You need to kill it before it finishes charging the gauge
* The more pixies you killed in Phase 4, the longer the gauge duration, but also the tougher the boss
* The battle penalties returned and got more severe
* Typically prioritize Brave / Weakness / Matk while Black Mages nuke it down in quick succession
* Due to the reload increase and Max BP decrease, specials have to be carefully selected
* Max BP is the 40% of your original Max BP
* It is possible to carefully time your specials so that you can cast the specials right before the penalty, and get the effects in.
	* White Mage to flick when the previous attack was ending (or finishing the cast).
	* Black Mage depends on whether Fastcast is on, somewhere between White Mage and the rest.
	* Knight/Thief/Ranger to flick when the summoning script appears.
	* Note that only buffs work, no damage will kick in. For Ranger, only AoE debuffs/dispel work.
	* Same can be applied in other phase transitions. However, for Ranger Phase 3, it is not recommended as you have to be ready to dispel.

# Tips
## Knight
* Poison and Waste immunity
* Bind, Bleed if possible
* Phalanx 2, 3 (won't have BP to cast Phalanx 1 in Phase 5)

## Black Mage
* Blind, Waste, Bleed immunity
* Demon, New Year 17 and Ancient Rods are required
* High DPS requirement to defeat the boss

## White Mage
* Poison, Waste, Bleed immunity
* Bind if possible
* Due to reload increase, powerful auto heal is needed for one of the White Mages
* Typical for one of the White Mages to go mono wind
* Build in a way to maximize Black Mage DPS in quick succession
* More hastes help

## Thief
* Blind, Waste, Bleed immunity
* Very high equipment requirement
* Forsake auto build, use pure special builds
* Phoenix Dagger / Umbrella Dagger and 2 or 3 Dark Angel daggers are required
* Significant BP cost reduction and limit break increase are required

## Ranger
* Bleed, Waste immunity
* Bind, Poison if possible
* Weakness 3 build is highly recommended
* At least Weakness 3, 1, Dispel and Mdef down
* BP cost cut to allow more specials possible during Phase 5
* For mono water, 3-star Weakness 1 bow is better than 5-star Snowman bow due to low BP cost
* No need extension since the boss randomly cleanses debuffs now and then
