### Notes
While I list them by effects, take note of the followings:
* <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/1IPYTuvl.JPG" width="20" alt="Legend Coin"> indicates the particular effect is unlocked at skill level 15, i.e. consume 5 legend coins. There will also be a legend coin in the equipment picture.
* <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/7tZLFGPP.png" width="20" alt="Slot Effect"> indicates the particular effect is a slot effect. The slot number in the equipment picture will appear black.
* The horizontal order of the equipment pictures is the same as the vertical order of the tables.
* :o: indicates that among the weapons with the same effect, that weapon is exceptionally recommended compared to the rest.

The tiering is based on early game value while endgame value is rated separately for each gear. Endgame Tier lists the gears you will want eventually as you hit the endgame but not beginner-friendly.

# S Tier

**Phalanx 2** 

* Endgame Value: S
* Type: Party Support
* Augments party damage incredibly. Since Phalanx 3 requires mono sets, Phalanx 2 is the one to go.

Swords that **extend own buffs** and **cleansing own debuffs** are a great combination. They are especially good to extend Phalanx 3 that comes with 30% Max BP penalty each use.

Swords with **healing auto** is extremely important to maintain aggro, especially in content where taunts do not work so well, e.g. Abyss 90 and 95.

**Command 2** is very helpful in content that extends reload such as Abyss 95 and 100. Does not work on the caster, however.
