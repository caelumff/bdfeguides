### Notes
While I list them by effects, take note of the followings:
* The horizontal order of the equipment pictures is the same as the vertical order of the tables.
* When the particular effect is unlocked at skill level 15, i.e. consume 5 legend coins, there will be a legend coin in the equipment picture.
* When the particular effect is a slot effect, the slot number in the equipment picture will appear black.

The tiering is based on early game value while endgame value is rated separately for each gear. Endgame Tier lists the gears you will want eventually as you hit the endgame but not beginner-friendly.

The most important jobs of white mages as healers are to heal and cleanse debuffs. Since most books heal, so you need to have **Cleanse** books.

<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Tamatebako | :o: Cleanse + Haste 2. Fastest cast time of the four.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> Tropical Drink (Boat / Summer 2017) | :o: Cleanse + Haste 2. Low BP cost. With 5 legend coins it comes with the much valuable buff extension.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Road of Grimoire | 2-row Heal + Haste 2 + Brave 1. Significantly different from the rest since it heals instead of cleanses.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/d7KNBOoa.png" width="20" alt="Wind"> Glitzy Grimoire | 2-row Cleanse + Haste 2. While having low BP cost, the cast time is painfully slow.

**Haste** is very strong especially in the beginning where you do not have enough reload reduction.

**Standard heal and buff books with Spirit buff**. They are easy to use because of their high healing power and Spirit buff which makes following heals more powerful. 

Endgame Value: S

<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Holy Dragon Grimoire | Heal + Patk/Pdef/Spirit buffs. Good for physical bosses / thief DPS party.

**BP Recovery** books are very excellent party supports that allow party to use more specials. Since they give BP back to you too, they are easy to use.

Endgame Value: S

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Daybreak Book (New Year 2018) | Whole field BP with very fast cast time. The most versatile and easy-to-use BP book.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> Detective Book | Heal + BP. Slightly less BP recovery (15% compared to 20%) than other books but it comes with Haste 1 and Proud 1 (slot effect) which can turn out to be handy.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Bull Book | <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/7tZLFGPP.png" width="20" alt="Slot Effect"> Heal + BP. Having slightly long cast time and very long reload make it the a little hard to use.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Blessing Hymn (Christmas 2018) | <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/7tZLFGPP.png" width="20" alt="Slot Effect"> 2-row Heal + BP. Lowest BP cost while maintaining reasonable reload/cast time make it highly valuable.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/d7KNBOoa.png" width="20" alt="Wind"> Choco Assort (Valentines 2019) | <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/7tZLFGPP.png" width="20" alt="Slot Effect"> Max HP/BP Buff with BP recovery at slot 4. While it recovers less BP, its combination with Max BP buff makes it stronger as you spam it more.

2-row **Max HP/BP Buff**. Very good for survival as well as to make BP book restore more. Be careful that if you use them without Spirit buffs, your heal may not keep up with the HP.

Endgame Value: S

<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Ancient Grimoire | Being as the same element as New Year 2018 book has its advantage.

Heal + **Patk/Pdef/Matk/Mdef** buffs. Potent buff books but with weak healing power. Especially great for hybrid bosses / party. However difficult to rely on for heals.

**Revive** books. They should not be too useful in the beginning since you will probably die before others until you have proper armours.

Endgame Value: A

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Lotus Book (New Year 2019) | :o: Useful 2-row revive book with BP recovery. More powerful with more fire books.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> King's Book | Needing at least 3 water books to work and long cast time make it difficult to use. The only advantage is it works on the whole field.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Euclid Book | While it works on 2 rows, having the longest cast time (4.5s) in the whole game makes it a pain to use. Becomes standard 2.5s with 5 legend coins, however.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Royal Book | :o: One of the best, easiest to use revive books.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/d7KNBOoa.png" width="20" alt="Wind"> Eril Grimoire | :o: One of the best, easiest to use revive books.

**Buff extension** is very valuable. With good reload and BP reduction endgame build, it is possible to infinitely extend buffs for the rest of the battle. While white mage buffs are naturally long due to their innate effects, it benefits the DPS in the party the most since DPS buffs are significantly shorter.

<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Demon Book | :o: Heal + Brave 2 + extend buffs 15s. Brave 2 being a important buff makes it the best of all extension books.
