### Notes
While I list them by effects, take note of the followings:
* The horizontal order of the equipment pictures is the same as the vertical order of the tables.
* When the particular effect is unlocked at skill level 15, i.e. consume 5 legend coins, there will be a legend coin in the equipment picture.
* When the particular effect is a slot effect, the slot number in the equipment picture will appear black.

The tiering is based on early game value while endgame value is rated separately for each gear. Endgame Tier lists the gears you will want eventually as you hit the endgame but not beginner-friendly.

# S Tier

## Dispel

* Endgame Value: S
* The most important job of a ranger is to Dispel dangerous buffs on a boss.

# A Tier

## Weakness 2

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/R25mf0Um.png)
* Endgame Value: S
* The current game usually requires or is advantageous for dealing a lot of damage in a short time. This is why **Weakness 2** is highly coveted.

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Chain Bow | Low BP cost but short duration.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Gambling of the Demon | Comes with Forceles 2 and an additional random debuff. The random debuff is not reliable but it is a fine bow without it regardlessly.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> King's Bow | -
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Sakura Bow | Does no damage and short duration but comes with Forceless 2.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Star of Carol (Christmas 2018) | Short duration but being AoE and coming with AoE debuff extension make it excellent.

## Patk/Pdef/Matk/Mdef Down

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/jzs8ydEG.png)
* Endgame Value: S
* Despite Forceless being counterpart of Weakness, **Stat-reduction** actually works better than Forceless in reducing incoming damage, while letting party to deal more damage as a bonus (generally stronger than Weakness 1 in that aspect).

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Demon Bow | Short duration.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> Space Military Shot | -
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/d7KNBOoa.png" width="20" alt="Wind"> Twilight Bow | Single target but lighter on BP and reload.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/d7KNBOoa.png" width="20" alt="Wind"> Legend Bow | Comes with self Hawkeye 2 buff.

## Debuff Extension

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/WvGpYUT3.png)
* Endgame Value: S
* Debuff Extension is very helpful to ensure that the debuffs stay on instead of keeping track of expiration time of each buff, especially if there's a knight who uses taunt. It takes some BP and reload reduction to have infinite extension, howerver.

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/OZ546Nl3.png)
* Endgame Value: S
* Slow decreases the frequency of attacks. It is mostly used to give the party more room to cast specials or to nuke down the boss. It is more important in fast bosses or fast mechanics. 

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Ancient Bow | Slow/slowcast 2. The fire AoE auto is good in farming pq.

<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/d7KNBOoa.png" width="20" alt="Wind"> Cupid Bow (Valentine's 2018) | Slow 2. Typically only used for mono wind.

## Slowcast

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/IHZ3EeAo.png)
* Endgame Value: S
* Slowcast gives more room to dodge red tiles or brace for upcoming attacks. It also slightly decreases the frequency of attacks like Slow but not its main purpose. It is very important in bosses with many fast and/or lethal red tiles.

# Endgame Tier

## Mono Elemental Sets

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/D8j6mcgQ.png)
* Although support roles do not have to gear elemental to deal damage unlike DPS roles, there are several reasons that they do need to gear mono elemental sets.
	* Easy on BP and reload.
	* There are many support weapons that carry very strong effects that only activate when you gear mono elemental sets.

***

## Weakness 3

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/fOk3170G.png)
* Weakness 3*with mono elements. Very strong end game but difficult to make use for beginners. 

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Bear Bow | Weakness 3 with mono fire set.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> Squirrel Bow | Weakness 3 with mono water set.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Heavenly Arrow | Weakness 3 with mono earth set.

## Chaser

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/BofBhDlF.png)
* Chaser is eventually wanted to maximize damage output of DPS especially when they are already hitting the damae cap.
