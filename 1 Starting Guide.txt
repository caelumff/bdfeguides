# Jobs
## Knight
Tank with a lot of playstyles depending on weapons. 

The main job of knights is to be targetted by enemies and to bait the attacks away from the party. How likely you are to be targeted is gauged by a term called *aggro*, related to how much hate you can generate from the enemies. There are also other amazing party support available to knights.

## Black Mage
Magical DPS with strong and some AoE special attacks. 

Black mage's rods usually provide buffs that augment own or party damage. They have unparalleled damage in terms of AoE. AoE attacks usually have their damage split among all targets, but Black Mage has Concentrate to negate that to deal full damage. All spells come with casting time, so timing is important. Also black mages are fragile to physical attacks. It is also a fun and challenging job.

White Mage has a tough job that not only to keep allies alive, but also to buff them, shorten reload time with Haste, cleanse debuffs and supply BP. All spells come with casting time, so White Mage has toavoid killing themselves or killing allies when casting. Also, all buffs have varying duration. Hence, there are a lot of information to keep in mind when playing. Hence it is very challenging but rewardingto become a good white mage.

## Ranger
Debuffer that also deals some physical / magical / DoT damage. Important in most hard contents.

Ranger's main job is to dispel enemy buffs while inflicting debuffs to turn the battle to the party's favour. Since debuffs usually have short duration, there are debuff extension bows to extend debuffs already inlicted on the enemy.

# Gacha
Gacha are split into mythril gacha and ticket gacha.

## Mythril Gacha
Mythril is the premium currency in this game, where it is split into free mythril and paid mythril. Mythril gacha is always separated by jobs, meaning you will only get what the job can use.

The general gacha rate is as follows unless stated otherwise:

* Separated by job: 64% 3-star / 30% 4-star / 6% 5-star
* While the contents of 3-star and 4-star are more or less fixed (mostly fodders). The contents of 5-star vary from gacha to gacha.

*Gacha events change from time to time, the following is true for the time when this guide is written.*

Job Gacha/Fest

* 3% evenly distributed among WEAPONs released
* 3% evenly distributed among ARMOURs released
* Job Gacha is permanently available while Job Fest is an event
* During Job Fest, for doing a 10-pulls, the first pull will be a guaranteed 5-star, but only available once a day.
	* 50% evenly distributed among WEAPONS and ARMOURS released respectively

Elemental Fest

* Same as Job Gacha / Fest but contain only equipment for one specific element.
* Chance to get with EX weapons that can inherit 2 specials and 2 normal effects, more about them in Inheritance Guide.

Box Gacha

* All new equipment pieces are launched in the form of Box Gacha.
* 126 3-star, 62 4-star, 8 5-star pieces in the pool.
* 5-star pieces (in general):
	* 1 New Weapon
	* 3 New Armours
	* 1 Old Weapon
	* 3 Old Armours
* Once a piece is pulled, it is removed from the pool. Rate for each piece is always 6% divided by number of remaining pieces.
* Once all pieces of a rarity are pulled, the rarity is removed from the equation. Otherwise, the rate always remains 64% : 30% : 6%.
* There is a red button below the pulling button named Reset. It resets the content of the box to before you start pulling. Only push if you want multiple copies of the same item.

Step Up

* Like a set package of gacha. Freebies, guaranteed 5-star are offered as you pull more to complete the steps.
* May have special pools depending on the gacha. Currently, they are mostly slotted weapons step up (i.e. weapons with slot effects).
* Typically cost 300~500 mythril.

Vintage Gacha

* The contents of 5-stars are all armours.
* Chance to get Wakoku/Bravo gears that can inherit 2 normal effects.

	* Chance is split among Hat/Chest/Pants for all 4 elements, i.e. 12 pieces.
* Rare chance to get time-limited recoloured 5-star armours as 4-star.
	* No practicality, simply for fashion

Paid Mythril

* (Permanent) Daily 1 pull per 5 paid mythril for Job Gacha, with regular rate
* (Event) Guaranteed 5-star per 150 paid mythril in Elemental Fest / Vintage.

## Ticket Gacha
The rate of ticket gacha is unpublished. Tickets in this game yield random items. You may not select a pool to use the tickets on. The currently released recurring tickets:

Red | Used on specific job only, starting from 3-star.
Blue | Able to select job, starting from 3-star.
Gold | Able to select job, starting from 4-star.
Pink | Able to select job, 5-star only.
Green | Random jobs, 10 pulls per ticket.

Red and blue are the most common forms of tickets. Gold is received in events regularly, but pink and green are very rare. eku53ru logged the results of red and blue ticket pulls and have the following results: 82% 3-star / 15% 4-star / 3% 5-star.

## Beginner / Reroll

It is easier to get armors later on from boxes or Vintage gacha. Therefore, it is generally suggested to reroll for weapons. Pictures of weapons with short descriptions are in the reroll suggestion channels in the Discord. 

Every new account starts with 10 random rolls for selected job with 1 guaranteed 5-star. There are also weapon-only and armour-only start-dash with guaranteed 5-star that can only be pulled using 75 paid Mythril. 1 time per job per type per account. The start-dash will only be available for 72 hours after account creation. 

**Beginner Boost**: Please note that within one week of starting, there is a honeymoon period that you get boosted pq drop, rare encounters, item drop rate and EXP gain for a week. It is a good time to quickly catch up when the boost is still going on.
