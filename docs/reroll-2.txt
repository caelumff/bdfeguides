**Aspir** is a very overpowered buff, giving near endless BP supply. Since Black Mages main in dealing damage with flashy and explosive special attacks. So having healthy BP supply is mandatory to deal consistent damage. All three aspir rods have standard attack power while offering another buff.

Since Black Mages are usually fragile while often targeted by enemies without a Knight around, **Magic Barrier** is extremely helpful to help Black Mages survive.

**Split** and **Concentrate** allow Black Mages to have unparalleled AoE DPS. Most rods carry these two buffs in one except wind.

**Dualcast** rods allow Black Mages to deal damage quickly in a short time, especially useful for beginners without enough reload reduction.

**Fast Cast** allows Black Mages to bombard specials quickly. However their true potential is only when Black Mages have enough BP supply and special reload reduction. Highly coveted endgame.

While not carrying buffs, these **2-hit nukes** with 50% MDef ignore hit really hard. They have slightly faster cast time at 2.0s too.
