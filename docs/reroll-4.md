### Notes
While I list them by effects, take note of the followings:
* <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/1IPYTuvl.JPG" width="20" alt="Legend Coin"> indicates the particular effect is unlocked at skill level 15, i.e. consume 5 legend coins. There will also be a legend coin in the equipment picture.
* <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/7tZLFGPP.png" width="20" alt="Slot Effect"> indicates the particular effect is a slot effect. The slot number in the equipment picture will appear black.
* The horizontal order of the equipment pictures is the same as the vertical order of the tables.
* :o: indicates that among the weapons with the same effect, that weapon is exceptionally recommended compared to the rest.

# S Tier

Thieves excel in auto attacks. So it is the most important to get **Shadow** and **Quick** buffs to augment auto attack damage and speed. These daggers combine two potent buffs of Shadow 2 and Quick 2 in one, making them highly coveted.

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> Anchemical Cross | While it also deals damage, Thieves typically don't deal a lot of damage from specials.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/d7KNBOoa.png" width="20" alt="Wind"> Violin Dagger | :o: Longer duration and instant self buff animation. Significantly better than the other one. The best dagger that can be slotted in all elemental sets.

**Dagger Stance** is insanely powerful that makes each auto attack stronger with each hit as long as the Thief does not get hit, up to 200% bonus line of the original damage. Pairs well with Dodge 2 buff and smart red tile dodging.

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/d7KNBOoa.png" width="20" alt="Wind"> Argent Choco Fondue (Valentine's 2019) | Dagger Stance + Row Quick 1

# A Tier
## ![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/KcPqi2EK.png)
These daggers combine **Shadow 1** and **Quick 1** in one. Since they stack with Shadow 2 and Quick 2 respectively, they are typically used in conjunction with them. Both of these come with Assault 1 as a bonus but seldom utilized.

<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Road of Edge | High BP cost, long reload, short duration and painfully long animation make it less versatile than the rest.

**Focus** is highly destructive but requires specific setup and support to work. Hard to use in the beginning. 

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Ritual Dagger | The animation is painfully long.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> Space Military Cutter | Fast animation.

<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/d7KNBOoa.png" width="20" alt="Wind"> Legend Knife | Long duration.

These two **fire pure buff** daggers are usually paired together and both provide excellent buffs with long/decent duration. Since Thieves are not typically built for special damage, pure buff daggers end up superior in having fast animation, light on BP/reload, and ignoring Bleed debuffs.

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Phoenix Dagger | Shadow 2 + Assault 2 in one with instant self buff animation. Good if you are spamming specials on top of auto attacks. 
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Dual-Axes | Quick 2 + Shadow 1 + Assault 1. Good to pair with other daggers with Shadow 2 but not Quick 2. 

***

## ![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/9z8xb6WA.png)
Thieves have typically low defenses. **Dodge** buff allows Thieves to shrug off a large portion of attacks when paired with their innately high evasion stat. Good to pair with Dagger Stance buff.

Name | Description

<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Sakura Dagger | High BP cost, long reload and short duration makes it difficult to use.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/d7KNBOoa.png" width="20" alt="Wind"> Quartz Dagger | Long duration and self Patk buff if invested legend coins.

# B Tier

Thieves do not have built-in limit break. Single line autos end up with insufficient damage output eventually. While most **multi-line autos** are usually slower, these are the better ones with exceptional speed, reliability and power. 100% aim is a good bonus because auto attacks tend to miss more often and allows Thieves to ignore blind.

Name | Speed | Description
---|---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Lotus Dagger (New Year 2019) | 4.0s 2-line | 50% being 0.5s faster when targetting wind. Power bonus once awakened.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> Stardust Dagger | 4.0s 2-line 100% aim | Assault 2 + Dodge 2 pure buffs.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> King's Dagger | 4.0s 2-line 100% aim | Shadow/Assault/Boost 1. Innate autoã€€BP +1 makes it good to pair with Focus.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> Ruin Blade | 4.5s 3-line | Power bonus once awakened. Row Shadow/Quick/Assault 1.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Spiritual Edge | 4.0s 2-line 100% aim | Weak HP drain.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/d7KNBOoa.png" width="20" alt="Wind"> Twilight Dagger | 4.0s 2-line 100% aim | -
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/d7KNBOoa.png" width="20" alt="Wind"> Glitzy Cross | 3.5s 2-line 100% aim | One of the best auto in the game. Wind auto reload reduction is usually event limited, however. Assault 2 + weak HP drain, might be useful depending on build.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/d7KNBOoa.png" width="20" alt="Wind"> Argent Choco Fondue (Valentine's 2019) | 4.0s 2-line 100% aim | Dagger Stance + Row Quick 1.

While Assault does not help Thieves themselves very much, **Row Assault** buffs are very coveted for Black Mages in the party.

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> Ruin Dagger | Row Shadow/Quick/Assault 1.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> Antique Dagger | Row Assault 3.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Dragon Slayer Dagger | Row Assault 2.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Heavenly Edge | Row Assault 3.

**C Tier**

Other **Shadow 2** and **Quick 2** daggers. They are still useable but not as good as the ones mentioned above.

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Fool's Knife | Row Shadow 2 buff but comes with 3s cast time.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Twin Ghost (Halloween 2017) | Quick 2
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> Squirrel Dagger | Shadow 2
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Euclid Dagger | Quick 2
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Zeroth Type Dagger | Shadow 2

Single line autos are inferior end-game. But some **faster single-line autos** are useful when you are not hitting the damage cap yet or enough buffs. (i.e. useful while solo or starting but start to become insufficient as you party end-game)

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Holy Dragon Dagger | 4.0s, 50% -0.5s when opponent is wind. Low stats however.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Dark Angel Edge | 4.0s, -0.5s under Patk buff. Comes with fast animation 3-line nuke special if you build for special too.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Phoenix Dagger | 4.0s, 30% -0.5s.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> Ancazas Dagger | 4.0s, 50% -0.5s when opponent is fire. Low stats however.

# Special Mention
## ![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/olist/A0iwELoq.png)
These hats give Thieves permanent 20% auto damage bonus at slot 1, increasing Thieves damage output significantly. However they are difficult to pull when there is only one set in the game with such unique effects.
