### Notes

* <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/1IPYTuvl.JPG" width="20" alt="Legend Coin"> indicates the particular effect is unlocked at skill level 15, i.e. consume 5 legend coins. There will also be a legend coin in the equipment picture.
* <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/7tZLFGPP.png" width="20" alt="Slot Effect"> indicates the particular effect is a slot effect. The slot number in the equipment picture will appear black.

The most important jobs of white mages are to heal and cleanse debuffs. Since most books heal, so **Cleanse** books are your targets. And among the buffs, **Haste** is usually the most important, especially for the White Mages themselves. Cleanse and Haste happen to be put together often, thus the following books. 

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Tamatebako | :o: Cleanse + Haste 2. Fastest cast time of the four.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> Tropical Drink (Boat / Summer 2017) | :o: Cleanse + Haste 2. Low BP cost.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Road of Grimoire | 2-row Heal + Haste 2 + Brave 1. Significantly different from the rest since it heals instead of cleanses. Having so many effects yet with reasonably low BP cost and reload makes it one of the most coveted books.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/d7KNBOoa.png" width="20" alt="Wind"> Glitzy Grimoire | 2-row Cleanse + Haste 2. While having low BP cost, the cast time is painfully slow.

# A Tier

**Standard heal and buff books with Spirit buff**. These often form the base of most sets due to high healing power and Spirit buff makes following heals more powerful. 

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Holy Dragon Grimoire | Heal + Patk/Pdef/Spirit buffs. Good for physical bosses / thief DPS party. 
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/d7KNBOoa.png" width="20" alt="Wind"> Condemnation Book | Heal + Matk/Mdef/Spirit buffs. Good for magical bosses / blm DPS party.

**BP** Books are very excellent party supports that allow party to use more specials. Since they give BP back to you too, they are easy to use.

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Daybreak Book (New Year 2018) | Whole field BP with very fast cast time. The most versatile and easy-to-use BP book.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Bull Book | Heal + BP. Having slightly long cast time and very long reload make it the a little hard to use.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Blessing Hymn (Christmas 2018) | 2-row Heal + BP. Lowest BP cost while maintaining reasonable reload/cast time make it highly valuable.

# B Tier
## ![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/8Ocw57pj.png)
2-row **Max HP/BP Buff**. Very good for survival as well as to make BP book restores more. Be careful that if you use them without Spirit buffs, your heal may not keep up with the HP.

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Ancient Grimoire | Being as the same element as New Year 2018 book has its advantage.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/d7KNBOoa.png" width="20" alt="Wind"> Choco Assort (Valentines 2019) | Comes with 10% BP recovery at slot 4.

**Revive** books. Take note that many have their own limitations.

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Lotus Book (New Year 2019) | :o: Useful 2-row revive book with BP recovery. More powerful with more fire books.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> King's Book | Needing at least 3 water books to work and long cast time make it difficult to use. The only advantage is it works on the whole field.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Euclid Book | While it works on 2 rows, having the longest cast time (4.5s) in the whole game makes it a pain to use.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Royal Book | :o: One of the best, easiest to use revive books.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/d7KNBOoa.png" width="20" alt="Wind"> Eril Grimoire | :o: One of the best, easiest to use revive books.

Heal + **Patk/Pdef/Matk/Mdef** buffs. Potent buff books but with weak healing power. Especially great for hybrid bosses / party. However difficult to rely on for heals unless with Ice Golem Medals.

While **Brave 2** is available in 4-star as an awakening effect, these offer some utilities that let them be recommended as well.

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Demon Book | Heal + Brave 2 + extend buffs 15s. The heal + buff extension makes this book very handy in supporting dps without worrying about health, casting Brave 2 at the same time.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Black Cat's Footsteps (Halloween 2018) | 2-row Brave 2 + Proud 2. While it does not heal, it offers Proud 2 that lets you spam other specials more easily.

**Brave 3** with mono elements. Very strong end game but difficult to make use for beginners.
