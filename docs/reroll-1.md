### Notes
While I list them by effects, take note of the followings:
* <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/1IPYTuvl.JPG" width="20" alt="Legend Coin"> indicates the particular effect is unlocked at skill level 15, i.e. consume 5 legend coins. There will also be a legend coin in the equipment picture.
* <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/7tZLFGPP.png" width="20" alt="Slot Effect"> indicates the particular effect is a slot effect. The slot number in the equipment picture will appear black.
* The horizontal order of the equipment pictures is the same as the vertical order of the tables.
* :o: indicates that among the weapons with the same effect, that weapon is exceptionally recommended compared to the rest.

**Phalanx 3** is very strong by massively boosting party damage. While fire set is also available, **mono wind set** is generally better due to more healing specials and Glitzy extension. Currently this wind set is so good that it is recommended for Knights to reroll for a Wind set during Wind Festival if willing to spend time. Note: There are other wind swords that are helpful in a mono wind set, but these are the more important ones.

Increasing **Max HP** and **Healing** at the same time boost your survival instantly. In addition, Regen heals more with your Max HP after HP buffs.

Swords that **extend own buffs** and **cleansing own debuffs** are a great combination. They are especially good to extend Phalanx 3 that comes with 30% Max BP penalty each use.

Name | Description

<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Crimson Katana | Shorter reload and self healing make it very powerful.

**Command 2** seems pretty strong on paper to help out with party reload and buff extension since the presence of Knigh usually eliminates chance of two White Mages. Does not work on Knight itself, however. Might need more time for real usage examples tho.

**Phalanx 1** swords are good to pair with Phalanx 2 swords. However 3-star swords with Phalanx 1 as awakening effects are sufficient mostly.
