### Notes
While I list them by effects, take note of the followings:
* The horizontal order of the equipment pictures is the same as the vertical order of the tables.
* When the particular effect is unlocked at skill level 15, i.e. consume 5 legend coins, there will be a legend coin in the equipment picture.
* When the particular effect is a slot effect, the slot number in the equipment picture will appear black.

The tiering is based on early game value while endgame value is rated separately for each gear. Endgame Tier lists the gears you will want eventually as you hit the endgame but not beginner-friendly.

# S Tier

## Shadow 3

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/dAIwr70z.png)
* **Shadow 3** is a powerful buff that directly increases your damage output reliably.

Endgame Value: S

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> Detective Dagger | Shadow 3 + Assault 1

## Shadow/Quick 2

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/j0T2Li85.png)
* Thieves excel in swift auto attacks. So it is important to make your auto attacks as fast as you can with Quick buffs. These daggers combine two potent buffs of **Shadow 2** and **Quick 2** in one, making them highly coveted.

Endgame Value: S

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> Anchemical Cross | While it also deals damage, Thieves typically don't deal a lot of damage from specials.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/d7KNBOoa.png" width="20" alt="Wind"> Violin Dagger | :o: Longer duration and instant self buff animation. Significantly better than the other one. The best dagger that can be slotted in all elemental sets.

***

# A Tier

## Dodge 2

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/qbQqk0Vv.png)
* Thieves have typically low defenses. **Dodge 2** buff allows Thieves to shrug off a large portion of attacks in combination with their innately high evasion stat.

Endgame Value: A

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Gicchou Dagger (New Year 2018) | -
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> Stardust Dagger | Dodge 2 + Assault 2.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Sakura Dagger | High BP cost, long reload and short duration makes it difficult to use.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/d7KNBOoa.png" width="20" alt="Wind"> Quartz Dagger | Long duration and self Patk buff if invested legend coins.

## Shadow 2

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/ZnSypbL6.png)
* Other **Shadow 2** daggers.

Endgame Value: A

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Fool's Knife | Row Shadow 2 buff but comes with 3s cast time.

<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Zeroth Type Dagger | Shadow 2

***

## Quick 2

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/AzD7H7WD.png)
* Other **Quick 2** daggers. While Quick buffs are less significant when you do not have other forms of auto reload reduction, they become more vital as your auto reload becomes faster.

Endgame Value: S

# B Tier

## Fast Single-Line Autos

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/ildGq6iB.png)
**Faster single-line autos** are usually stronger and faster than multi-line autos. They are useful when you are not hitting the damage cap yet or not enough buffs. (i.e. useful while solo or beginner)

Endgame Value: B

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Holy Dragon Dagger | 4.0s, 50% -0.5s when opponent is wind. Low stats however.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Dark Angel Edge | 4.0s, -0.5s under Patk buff. Comes with fast animation 3-line nuke special if you build for special too.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Phoenix Dagger | 4.0s, 30% -0.5s.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> Ancazas Dagger | 4.0s, 50% -0.5s when opponent is fire. Low stats however.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> Bells of Saint (Christmas 2017) | 4.0s, 30% -0.5s.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> Legendary Pompom (Sports 2018) | 4.0s, 30% -0.5s.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Blue Sky Dagger | 4.0s, 50% -0.5s when opponent is water. Low stats however.

<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/d7KNBOoa.png" width="20" alt="Wind"> Condemnation Dagger | 4.0s, 50% -0.5s when opponent is earth. Low stats however.

## Good Multi-Line Autos

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/lN9wOSfM.png)
Thieves do not have built-in limit break. Single line autos end up with insufficient damage output eventually, that is when **multi-line autos** come into the picture. They are usually slower, these are the better ones with exceptional speed, reliability and power. 100% aim is a good bonus because auto attacks tend to miss more often and allows Thieves to ignore blind resistance.

Endgame Value: S

Name | Speed | Description
---|---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Lotus Dagger (New Year 2019) | 4.0s 2-line | 50% being 0.5s faster when targetting wind. Power bonus once awakened.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> Stardust Dagger | 4.0s 2-line 100% aim | Assault 2 + Dodge 2 pure buffs.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> King's Dagger | 4.0s 2-line 100% aim | Shadow/Assault/Boost 1. Innate autoã€€BP +1 makes it good to pair with Focus.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> Ruin Blade | 4.5s 3-line | Power bonus once awakened. Row Shadow/Quick/Assault 1.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Spiritual Edge | 4.0s 2-line 100% aim | Weak HP drain.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/d7KNBOoa.png" width="20" alt="Wind"> Twilight Dagger | 4.0s 2-line 100% aim | -
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/d7KNBOoa.png" width="20" alt="Wind"> Glitzy Cross | 3.5s 2-line 100% aim | One of the best auto in the game. Wind auto reload reduction is usually event limited, however. Assault 2 + weak HP drain, might be useful depending on build.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/d7KNBOoa.png" width="20" alt="Wind"> Argent Choco Fondue (Valentine's 2019) | 4.0s 2-line 100% aim | Dagger Stance + Row Quick 1.

## Row Assault

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/BexDcert.png)
While Assault does not help Thieves themselves very much, **Row Assault** buffs are very coveted for Black Mages when you happen to party.

Endgame Value: A

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> Ruin Dagger | Row Shadow/Quick/Assault 1.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> Antique Dagger | Row Assault 3.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Dragon Slayer Dagger | Row Assault 2.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Heavenly Edge | Row Assault 3.

***

# Endgame Tier

## Dagger Stance

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/dr6zO6b1.png)
* **Dagger Stance** is insanely powerful that makes each auto attack stronger with each hit as long as the Thief does not get hit, up to 200% bonus line of the original damage. Pairs well with Dodge 2 buff and smart red tile dodging. It takes a while to ramp up without enough auto reload reduction, however. Not easy to use for beginners.

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Crimson-Knot Kunai | Dagger Stance + Assault 1
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/KihfCICL.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Golden Khorpesh | Dagger Stance + Assault 1
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/d7KNBOoa.png" width="20" alt="Wind"> Argent Choco Fondue (Valentine's 2019) | Dagger Stance + Row Quick 1

## Focus

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/49iSizgw.png)
* **Focus** is highly destructive but requires specific setup and support to work. Hard to use in the beginning and solo-ing. 

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/2p740des.png" width="20" alt="Fire"> Ritual Dagger | The animation is painfully long.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> Space Military Cutter | Fast animation.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Dual Bone Meat (Halloween 2018) | -
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/d7KNBOoa.png" width="20" alt="Wind"> Legend Knife | Long duration.

***

## Quick 1

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/DX4cV5hK.png)
* Eventually, thieves will need all forms of auto reload reduction they can get. So, **Quick 1** is also an important buff to slot in.

Name | Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"><img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/7tZLFGPP.png" width="20" alt="Slot Effect"> Aqua Hook Sword | Short animation makes it easy to use.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"><img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/7tZLFGPP.png" width="20" alt="Slot Effect"> Ruin Blade | Longer duration but comes with 3s cast time (row buff).
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Road of Edge | High BP cost, long reload, short duration and painfully long animation make it less versatile than the rest.
